1. An Eclipse instance.
2. The coding standards for this repo. (Optional, but recommended)
3. The Android SDK. Install it yourself, not in the repo itself, and set the %ANDROID_HOME% PATH variable to where you installed it. If it's already in use (Not that it's a standardized PATH variable, it's not), let me know. (Note: This is optional if you don't plan on developing the Android module)
4. Enough bandwidth to clone this repo (Duh)
